# Attention-BiLSTM
This is the implementation codes for our paper titled "Describing Video with Attention based Bidirectional LSTM".
The implementation contains the best model with temporal attention during sentence generating and fusing with attention. Several dependencies for metrics evaluation should be download from coco evaluation server and put under the folder "pycocoevalcap". Do not remove or replace the "test_metrics.py" file which is a modification for our evaluation.
The coco evaluation also can be download from "https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption".
